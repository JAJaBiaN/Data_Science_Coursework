For this assignment, I was given two datasets contain transaction data.
One is labelled (transaction_one_base.csv) and one is unlabelled (transaction_two)base.csv).
Naturally, this corresponds to a training and test set of sorts.
Since the only machine learning algorithm(s) we were allowed to use was k-means (and technically PCA, principal component analysis),
the test set was more a way to create a full methodology.

Further details can be found in the Word document, uploaded as part of the assignment (Lab3 Fraud Detection Report - Applied Data Science.docx)
All code is in ADS Lab3.ipynb.
